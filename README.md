Bayesian Model Averaging in instrumental variable models.

## Usage

The main function is `givbma` which requires an outcome vector `y`, a matrix of endogenous variables `X`, a matrix of potential instruments `Z`, and a matrix of potential covariates `W`:
```
fit = givbma(y, X, Z, W)
```
will return a `GIVBMA` object containing a posterior sample of the model parameters averaged over the outcome and treatment models, the visited outcome and treatment models, and the input data. Alternatively, one can only specify a matrix `Z` of potential instruments and covariates:
```
fit = givbma(y, X, Z)
```
allows all columns of `Z` to be included in the outcome and treatment model. The optional keyword arguments are:
* `iter`: the number of iterations.
* `burn`: the number of iterations discarded as burn-in; the function returns `iter-burn` posterior samples.
* `dist`: a vector of distributions of the outcome and the endogenous variables (defaults to Gaussian). Currently, we support `"Gaussian"`, `"PLN"` (Poisson-Log-Normal), and `"BL"` (Beta-Logistic).
* `g_prior`: the choice of the g hyperparameter. Currently, we support `"BRIC"` (default) and `"hyper-g/n"`.
* `two_comp`: a Boolean indicating whether the two-component g-prior should be used in the treatment model (defaults to `false`). The two-component prior can only be used with a single endogenous variable (i.e. `X` only has a single column).
* `Î½`: the degrees of freedom parameter for the inverse Wishart prior on the covariance matrix. If not specified, this defaults to an Exponential hyperprior.
* `m`: the prior mean model size. If not specified, it defaults to `k/2` in the outcome model and `(k+p)/2` in the treatment model, where `k` is the number of exogenous covariates and `p` is the number of instruments.
* `r_prior`: a `Distribution` object specifying the prior on additional parameters for any non-Gaussian distributions involved. Currently, this only includes the dispersion parameter of the Beta-Logistic distribution (which defaults to an Exponential with scale 1).
